Before this semester i had done lots of theory courses and some of them 
had course project also.But implementing the theory in practical is really a complex task.

Theory doesn't talk about the real time and real world difficulties that we have to face 
after we install some system or build some system.

The main and most noticeable thing that i learned from this course is to implement a real 
world system and this system ,what i implemented is not like a toy system .I have considered most of 
real world difficulties and engineering problems that we face and while implementing the system i have taken
care about those difficulties and used some approach to rectify and
handle those cases.

Beside this i learned "How to handle and debug large projects ?"

And last one is about Go language.It is very interesting language and 
it gives us lots of packages and with those packages we can implement 
nice projects without getting much trouble.At the starting of the 
semester i struggled a little bit for using Go language in the assignments 
but now at the end of the semester i feel much more comfortable with this language.
